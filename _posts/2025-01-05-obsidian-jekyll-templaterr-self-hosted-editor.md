For a while i was searching for something to work as admin panel for my static blog site. There are few options like [Tina CMS](https://tina.io) but it needs a bit more configuration than what i wanted. I do confess i set it up once than abandoned it and never got around configuring it again so i wanted more simpler one, where i could just open up app, write and post. That's the beauty of Markdown and Obsidian.

When i first discovered static sites it was [Ghost](https://ghost.org) but its limitation on free themes set me back. After Ghost i found out about GoHugo, I absolutely love Hugo. Its speed, simplicity, fairly easy to learn and configure, community and the choices of themes. I still use Hugo in some of my website as i just can't let it go.

Now today i use Jekyll, I have no clue about Ruby or gem, all i know is i love this theme. I found this theme used by Techno Tim, a homelab Youtuber on his [website](https://technotim.live) and i absolutely loved it. As of today i haven't yet fully utilized all the features, i absolutely love what i have been using. Now don't get me wrong, i did have to learn a bit about jekyll to run this, especially version mismatch and other stuff i don't even know how i fixed it. But i did document how to recreate the site for liking in my [README](https://github.com/ghimireaacs/ghimireaacs.github.io) file. 

If you want to recreate this site you can follow along from this [link](https://github.com/ghimireaacs/ghimireaacs.github.io).
