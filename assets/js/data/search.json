    "content": "IntroductionFor a while i was searching for something to work as admin panel for my static blog site. There are few options like Tina CMS but it needs a bit more configuration than what i wanted. I do confess i set it up once than abandoned it and never got around configuring it again so i wanted more simpler one, where i could just open up app, write and post. That‚Äôs the beauty of Markdown and Obsidian.When i first discovered static sites it was Ghost but its limitation on free themes set me back. After Ghost i found out about GoHugo, I absolutely love Hugo. Its speed, simplicity, fairly easy to learn and configure, community and the choices of themes. I still use Hugo in some of my website as i just can‚Äôt let it go.Now today i use Jekyll, I have no clue about Ruby or gem, all i know is i love this theme. I found this theme used by Techno Tim, a home lab youtuber, on his website and i absolutely loved it. As of today i haven‚Äôt yet fully utilized all the features, i absolutely love what i have been using. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, i did have to learn a bit about jekyll to run this, especially version mismatch and other stuff i don‚Äôt even know how i fixed it. But i did document how to recreate the site for liking in my README file.If you want to recreate this site you can follow along from this link.PrerequisiteHere are some of the applications and plugins you will need to set"

    "content": "Let‚Äôs Block ads, those annoying little popups, with NextDNS. Before, we start that, let‚Äôs understand the concept of DNS.DNS according to Cloudflare is a Phonebook of Internet. It translates your domain name to ip  address. Each computer or device connected to internet has different IP address and its too much for us to remember those numbers. So instead of need to remembering addresses we have domain names. Such as this blog. Even though you write https://ghimireprashant.com in your address bar it points to 3.24.66.78. We can see it here:There are different kind of DNS, consult this Cloudflare Page to go deep. But we will keep it light here and see how we can block ads and basic concept of the website we are using.Now we know DNS points to website, imagine if it does not point to the ones you don‚Äôt want. Its such a simple concept yet so powerful.ADSWhen you go onto a website generally ads are loaded from another website, For example once the ads are allowed on this website it will load through google ads, which is ads.google.com. There are many ad servers like this that load another link on different sites. Some are annoying and intrusive, some are downright danger with Viruses and Malware on them. Regardless they do track your activity from your browser so they can play with your indulges and give you those ads. Talk for shoes, you‚Äôll see an ad within few minutes. You could‚Äôve thought of it and forgotten and saved your money but nope those intrusive ads are going to make you buy it. Even if you don‚Äôt want it. Some time it‚Äôs planted right on your brain. Watch the movie Focus if you want know how your subconscious works or read books on PSYOPs. So yeah Ads.Parental GuidanceI have a lot to vent about this, I am not sure if this is a right place but Nextdns or OpenDNS is surley gonna help you with your child‚Äôs activity in the internet.Internet is a wild wild west if you don‚Äôt know yet. Your kid don‚Äôt have to learn to use internet, they were born here. They were probably born because you found your wife on internet. They are product of that then, regardless, kids grow on Internet. They are going to learn a lot in it. Not always good things though. So if you are in Dilemma are have a second thought, let me remind you:  :zap: Your ignorance is not a good enough reason to let your child roam wild in the internet.One way of Filtering what your kid sees in the internet is filtering the websites they visit. You do so much for your child, work yourself to death, kill your own dreams when needed, put yourself through hell for them. Learning a little bit of monitoring them is nothing compared to what you go through every day. And with tools like this and basic concepts its very achievable.Do IT!NextDNSNext DNS or Open DNS are filtering DNS‚Äô they filter which sites can your device talk to. Next DNS is open source and many independent developers and Tech Enthusiasts go through their code to see any misinformation. So they are audited time to time. There are many resolver but I choose this because its easy to follow and have fairly usable UI and also offers free service for 6000 queries each month, which is good enough to monitor internet usage your school going kid. If you want to see other options, head over to PrivacyTools.io. If you really love it, there are paid plans that you can check too. Remember, this ain‚Äôt advertisement. I am not gonna receive anything from NextDNS or Privacytools.Alright let‚Äôs setup:  Head to nextdns.io      Signup, and you‚Äôll see the following page              My first Profile In this section you can setup multiple profiles with multiple settings for multiple devices, let‚Äôs say this is accounts within account. You can have different sets for your child, mobiles, pc, iphones, etc with each having different setting.              ID or IDS        This is your config id you are going to setup in your app or service.                    Menu Tabs        There are multiple tabs here as name suggests:                  Security: Default Settings is good enough, do visit it if you want to customise it.          Privacy: This is list of Custom List of Websites in the internet. This is more like community driven list which are updated in regular basis. Its basically library of websites you don‚Äôt usually need. Be careful though and choose the list as it may block some website you use on regular basis          Parental Control: This is one of two major tabs we are going to focus today.                               Websites Apps and Games: This is list of top level services and can be blocked with one click.              Categories: This has pre-filled categories given below.    Add whatever you want to block.              Recreation Time: With this option you can setup time for different websites on days like if you don‚Äôt want your child to watch tiktok after 9 PM. You can do it here.              Rest are Self explanatory              Youtube Restricted Mode is not fully functional yet, and generally discouraged to use in the community.                                Settings: I do not usually touch settings here. You can choose if you can enable logs options whether to log IPs, domains and which server you want them to be stored on. I go for Switzerland and leave it as it is so i can see what devices are accessing which websites. Its upto you at this point.                            Setup Guides        You can setup all these devices with the step by step guide given in the section.            Summary  DNS blocks unwanted site  DNS filters make it easy to use for everyone  Monitor your kids activity and let DNS handle itSo, there you have it Keep yourself and your kids secure from prying eyes of Internet.  :bulb: I am not associated with any products except this site ghimireprashant.com and its subdomains mentioned in the following article."

    "content": "Let‚Äôs see how many account do you have in the internet? Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, Twitter, Bank Account. Ah yeah Bank Account. Do you use same password for everything or atleast multiple accounts and never even changed that 2010 password you created and its everywhere. That my friend is a Red Flag.Look, I am aware, Internet Security seems like a bi66g deal to manage. But let me tell you a secret. You dot have to be the most secure person, just don‚Äôt be the easiest target. That‚Äôs all it is. You don‚Äôt want to be victim of some kid who watched a 10 minute Youtube video. Be wise, we‚Äôll worry about smart later.And who is wiser than the one who don‚Äôt only protect his past but also his future, right? RIGHT?Alright, let‚Äôs get into it.Make your Password ComplicatedThink of a book that has every word in English language, does it even exist? Everything? EVERYTHING? Well, it does, its called &gt;! Dictionary. A normal dictionary with 600,000 words would be 250MB. If you look for a big wordlists in google today you can download almost 45 GB of it. Point is, its not just dictionary terms that are vulnerable today but mixtures of letters, numbers and symbols too. I mean you don‚Äôt want to put ‚ÄòPassw0rd or Pa$$w0rd‚Äô as your password, the hackers are smart enough to keep those terms in the wordlists.Through the years, with so many breaches, we have collected a huge database of passwords around the world. Real world passwords used in real life. So there we have it A big book of passwords. Oh also these breaches do have email/username tied to them. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôd find yourself with your password next to it.Here, let‚Äôs go to a site that tells us if we‚Äôve ever been breached. Go to haveibeenpwned.com, type your email and see what it says. You can even write your password and see if it‚Äôs been ever breached. Site is secure.  :bulb: Tip: Trust but verify.Look at That. I am safe, are you?Now next Step!We have established we are not going to use weak password. Now what?Now we create strong passwords or pass phrases or pass-novels. You got the point. Make a word or sentence no one will guess, for each site and remember it.Password ManagerA password manager is something that saves your Password. Your device whether Apple, Android or your PC browser, already comes with password mananger. Remember when you go to a site and the id and passwords are already there? and everytime you use username and password in new site, there‚Äôs that annoying popup asking you to save your password. Yeah, that‚Äôs password manager.Even google and apple saves your passwords.Native or DefaultFor google, go to passwords.google.com. Sign in and there are your passwords saved in google.For browsers like chrome, Edge, Safari, go to Settings&gt;Profile&gt;Passwords.These comes with default so its easy for you to have multiple passwords. Apple |  Settings &gt; Passwords Android |  Settings &gt; General Management &gt; Passwords and Autofill. Microsoft Edge |  Settings &gt;Profile &gt; Passwords. Firefox |  Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Logins and Passwords &gt; Saved Logins.Third Party SoftwaresAmong third party softwares there are Some Paid, others free. NordPass, LesPass, KeePassXC, and one of the Popular Bitwarden.These Password Managers do not only save but also helps you to create passwords for you. But do not forget your Master Password and generate a strong one that you cna remember, One complex password should‚Äôt be tough to remember, have a faith.Wrap Up  Do Not use same passwords Multiple Times  Use Complex Passwords  Generate Passwords more than 12 letters.  Use Password Managers to Save or help you create Passwords  Create a strong Master Password and Remember it."
